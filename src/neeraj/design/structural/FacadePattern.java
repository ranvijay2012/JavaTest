/*
The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified, unified interface to a set
of interfaces in a subsystem. It helps hide the complexities of the system and provides a cleaner, higher-level API.

üß† Key Concepts
The Facade acts as a wrapper that delegates requests to the appropriate objects in the subsystem.
Helps decouple a client from a complex subsystem.
Makes the system easier to use for clients.

‚úÖ When to Use
When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex system.
To reduce coupling between subsystems and their clients.
To layer your application architecture (e.g., separating UI from business logic).

üß© Benefits
Simplifies usage for clients.
Decouples code from complex subsystem logic.
Promotes separation of concerns.

‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks
May become a "god object" if not carefully designed.
Overusing facades can hide important system functionality from users.
