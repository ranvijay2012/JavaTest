/*
The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage by
sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with
large numbers of objects that share common data.

üß† Key Concepts
Intrinsic State: Shared data that is common across many objects (stored in the flyweight object).
Extrinsic State: Data that is unique to each instance and must be passed in during method calls
(not stored in the flyweight object).
Flyweight Factory: Manages a pool of shared flyweight objects.

‚úÖ When to Use
You have a large number of objects.
Object instantiation is costly in terms of memory or performance.
Many of those objects share identical data.

üß© Benefits
Reduces memory consumption.
Improves performance in scenarios with many similar objects.
‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks
Code complexity increases.
You must carefully manage extrinsic state.
